CAN (Control Area Network)
---------------------------------------

A controller Area NetWork (CAN bus) is a robust vehicle bus standard designed
to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate will each other in 
applications without a host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed
originally for multiplex electrical wiring within automobiles to save on 
copper, but is also used in many other contexts.

CAN is a multi-master serial bus standard for connecting Electronic Control 
Units [ECUs] also known as nodes. Two or more nodes are required on the CAN 
network to communicate. The complexity of the node can range from a simple I/O
device up to an embedded computer with a CAN interface and sophisticated 
software. The node may also be a gateway allowing a general purpose computer 
(such as a laptop) to communicate over a USB or Ethernet port to the devices 
on a CAN network.
