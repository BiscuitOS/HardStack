SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) [中文](https://biscuitos.github.io/blog/SPI/)
-----------------------------------

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication 
interface specification used for short distance communication, primarily in
embedded systems. The interface was developed by Motorola in the mid 1980s
and become a de facto standard.

SPI devices communicate in full duplex mode using a master-slave architecture
with a single master. The master device originates the frame for reading and
writing. Multiple slave devices are supported through selection with individual
slave select (CS) lines.
