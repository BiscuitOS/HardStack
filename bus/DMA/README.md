DMA Usage
-----------------------------------------

In order to use DMA, we need offer a DMA driver and DMA application,
`kernel/dma.c` is CMA driver, and `user/dma_app.c` is CMA application.

## Kernel 

On kernel, we need add driver into kernel or as module.

## Userland

On userland, and compile and running dma application where in `user/dma_app.c`.
