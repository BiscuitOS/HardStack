.abort or .ABORT [中文教程](https://biscuitos.github.io/blog/GNUASM-.abort/)
--------------------------------------------------

### .abort

.abort

This directive stops the assembly immediately. It is for compatibility with other assemblers. The original idea was that the assembly language source would be piped into the assembler. If the sender of the source quit, it could use this directive to tell as to quit also. One day .abort will not be supported.

.ABORT is accepted as an alternate spelling of .abort.
