/*
 * SUB (Subtract) subtracts one value from a second value. The second value
 * comes from a register. The first value can be either an immediate value
 * or a value from a register, and can be shifted before the subtraction.
 * SUB can optionally update the condition code flags, based on the result.
 *
 * Syntax
 *   SUB{<cond>} {S} <Rd>, <Rn>, <shifter_operand>
 *
 * Usage
 *
 * - Use SUB to subtract one value from another. To decrement a register
 *   value (in Ri ) use:
 *       SUB Ri, Ri, #1
 * - SUBS is useful as a loop counter decrement, as the loop branch can 
 *   test the flags for the appropriate termination condition, without the
 *   need for a separate compare instruction:
 *       SUBS Ri, Ri, #1
 * - This both decrements the loop counter in Ri and checks whether it 
 *   has reached zero.
 * - You can use SUB , with the PC as its destination register and the S 
 *   bit set, to return from interrupts and various other types of 
 *   exception. See Exceptions on page A2-16 for more details.
