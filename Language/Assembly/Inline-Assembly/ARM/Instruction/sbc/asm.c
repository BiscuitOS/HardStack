/*
 * SBC (Subtract with Carry) subtracts the value of its second operand 
 * and the value of NOT(Carry flag) from the value of its first operand. 
 * The first operand comes from a register. The second operand can be 
 * either an immediate value or a value from a register, and can be 
 * shifted before the subtraction. Use SBC to synthesize multi-word 
 * subtraction. SBC can optionally update the condition code flags, based
 * on the result.
 *
 * Syntax
 *   SBC{<cond>} {S} <Rd>, <Rn>, <shifter_operand>
 *
 * Usage
 *
 * - If register pairs R0,R1 and R2,R3 hold 64-bit values (R0 and R2 hold
 *   the least significant words), the following instructions leave the 
 *   64-bit difference in R4,R5:
 *       SUBS R4,R0,R2
 *       SBC R5,R1,R3
